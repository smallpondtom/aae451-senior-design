%%CL_a_dot - Variation of airplane lift coefficient with
%%the rate of alpha
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%Assumptions:
%%CL_a_dot is the sum of the wing and horizontal tail
%%components, however, unless the wing is triangular in
%%shape, the wing component is assumed to be negligable.
%%This program does NOT incorporate triangular wings!
