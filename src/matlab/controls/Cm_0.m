% This function file calculates CL_0 - the aircraft zero-lift pitching moment coefficient
% It take in the following variables:
% S_h_slip			area of horizontal tail that is covered in prop-wash - see fig.(8.64) Ref.(3) [ft^2]
% S_h					area of horizontal tail [ft^2]
% S_w					aera of wing [ft^2]
% Lambda_c4			quater chord sweep angle [deg]
% lambda_w		   (wing) taper ratio
% M					Mach number
% tc_w				wing thickness to chord ratio
% alpha_0			Airfoil zero-lift AOA [deg]
% epsilon_t			horizontal tail twist angle [deg]
% i_w					wing incidence angle [deg]
% i_h					horizontal tail incidence angle [deg]
% epsilon_0_h 		Downwash angle at zero AOA [rad]
% wf_i            Average width of fuselage [ft]
% Deltax_i        Length of fuselage segment as shown in Fig. 8.112 of Ref(3) [ft]
%
% Cm_0_wf         The zero-lift pitching moment coefficient of the wing-fuselage combination (Pg. 320 of Ref(3))
% Cm_0_c          The zero-lift pitching moment coefficient of the canard
% Cm_0_h          The zero-lift pitching moment coefficient of the horizontal tail
% Cm_0_w          The zero-lift pitching moment coefficient of the wing
% Cm_0_f          The zero-lift pitching moment coefficient of the fuselage
%
% and returns the following variables to 'constant.m':
% Cm_0				aircraft zero-lift pitching moment coefficient
